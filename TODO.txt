			*figure out how to calculate torque based on motor location
		*figure out equation for translational movement based on translational force
			*figure out how to calculate translational force

	*have the axis of visualiztion change based on inputed data

	*finish writing sudo code for the PID sketch

	*create these clases

			V
	*Motor Class
		*variables
			*tau constant
			*orientation of the motor in vectors and angles for forward dirrection
			*max forward/reverse thrust
			*limit forwards and backwards for input command
			*current force
			*end force
			*time interval

		*methods
			*newMotor = createMotor(starting orientation, time interval)
			*force = getForce(desired Force, ROV orientation of ROV, time interval)
				*uses time interval to ramp up/down force based on tau
				*get new orienation from getNewOrienation() 
			*newOrientation = getNewOrienation(starting orientation, ROV orientation)
				*calculates the new orientation of motor in vectors and angles based on the starting and ROV rotation
			*forceInputToNewtons
				*converts the input signal to newtons
	 	

	*ROV class
		*variables
			*matrix storing each motor class variable
			*matrix with all three moments of inertia in Kg * m^2
			*mass of the Rov in Kg
			*matrix storing motors radius from moments
			*total surface area of Rov
			*orienation
			*x, y, z position


		*methods
			*createMotors(number of motors, time interval, max force)
			*updateRovOrientation(force1, force2, ..., forceN)
				*force1...forceN are the input to the motors, not the actual force
